### Note about hosting this demo in HF spaces

By default, the demo throws a 301 HTTP error, because HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS by HF.
This can be solved by adding in the HF space settings the environment variable `LOOPBACK_HOST_URL=https://<user-name>-<space-name>.hf.space` and speaches will use this var in its config to set the base URL for requests.
